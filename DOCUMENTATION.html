       Assignment 1: Since i hadn’t used sublime before I had a hard time figuring out how to push it to my repository.However I focused on just my recipes. I enjoyed the simplicity of the assignment because it gave me enough time to throughly experiment with each element of html which I wasn’t able to as much last semester. Just using html was a challenge on its own because I didn’t want to make it too simple but had to work within restraints. It was nice to experiment and see how much you’re able to do with simple html. Making each recipe unique was also a challenge because there weren’t too many unique elements we could use. However I learnt a lot from this assignment and I love the slow step by step approach we took towards re learning basic coding which is strengthening my basics

 Assignment 2: Positioning was something that was a problem for me. Even though I kept moving the absolute position by increasing the left number, it didn’t move. I ended up just randomly positioning it without giving it much thought. I even added negative figures, and I don’t know if that’s very effective in doing what I intended on doing. However I effectively learnt how to use divs which I had major issues with last semester. My basics are already getting cleared. Conceptually I learned basic things like the difference between divs and ids. I continued making small mistakes, like linking the wrong css file, missing a semi-colon, not naming the correct div. however I learnt to look for these particular errors (last semester when id encounter an error I didn’t know where to begin because I didn’t know my basics). Still having issues with pushing it to my website but I realized I just need to approach it in an organized manner and I’m confident that I would be able to over the weekend.
